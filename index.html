        <h3>Welcome to Regimo</h3>

<p>You already have a great looking website managed in WordPress, Drupal or Joomla but it's slow and unusable on a mobile phone? You would like it to load in a flash and look great on smartphones and tablets too without much effort? Regimo is what you are after.</p>

<hr><h3>More then just another CMS</h3>

<p>You have a great business idea and need a web application to manage your clients, staff, products, and events as well as features for communication and process automation, but you don't want to spend hundreds of thousands of $$$ for a commercial-of-the-shelf product (that doesn't do what you want anyway) or develop your application from scratch? You don't need to reinvent the wheel. Regimo can help you as it provides all the features every business needs. Just add your custom business component on top or choose from a large variety of existing modules and plug them into your instance of Regimo. It's that simple. And it's all yours.</p>

<p>There is still some feature missing. Have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/Polonious/Regimo/issues?milestone=&amp;state=open">Roadmap</a>. Maybe your missing feature is already on our radar. It's not? Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@polonious.com.au">support@polonious.com.au</a> and we will add it to the list or help you create your custom module.</p>

<hr><h3>Regimo in action</h3>

<p>Want to see Regimo in action? Checkout our company website <a href="http://www.polonious.com.au">www.polonious.com.au</a> or have a look at the <a href="http://regimo.poloniouslive.com">Regimo website</a> itself. Both websites are based on the Regimo framework. Browse the website on your PC with a big screen, your tablet, and your smartphone and you will see how the Regimo framework will customise the same content for these different devices.</p>
